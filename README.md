- This project is a container for all kinds of fooling around I do with my Raspberry Pi's.  
> This is really just my learning process.


## Objective and disclaimer
- Licensing should be addressed I suppose, but the intent is to make public all code which I don't aim to monetize.
- This project relies upon several physical and digital assets which will be listed below.  
- I have no affiliation with any entities, implied or expressed, listed below other than being a dude trying to learn some stuff and have some fun.
- I might break stuff, and am open to input/criticism/pull requests.
